## [**10m**] 🏆 Today's Goals

### Day 1: MVP

#### Requirements

- [ ] Create a command line interface that takes in one argument: the path to a text-based file in the same directory as your program. Example: `makesite go_notes.txt`
- [ ] Read in the contents the file specified.
- [ ] Render and save an HTML template that displays the contents of the file you read in.
- [ ] Manually test the HTML page by double-clicking the HTML file (output in the prior step) and opening it in your browser.

#### Stretch Challenges

- [ ] Use Bootstrap, or another CSS framework, to enhance the style and readability of your template. _Get creative! Writing your very own website generator is a great opportunity to broadcast your style, personality, and development preferences to the world!_
