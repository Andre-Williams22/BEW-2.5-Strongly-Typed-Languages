## Why You Should Know This (2 min)

Performance is an important factor in your applications! Today's lesson focuses on tools and techniques that help you **find broken, slow, or inefficient code faster than ever**. Benchmarking and testing are techniques that yield the kind of code that impresses peers and colleagues alike!

## Learning Objectives (3 min)

1. Identify and describe testing and benchmarking techniques that speed up your project.
2. Define `benchmark test` and `table test` and describe how they can be used together to improve the code quality of your project.
3. Implement benchmarking and testing via two in-class mini-tutorials.
4. Explore how to incorporate benchmarking and testing in your MakeUtility project.

## Overview/TT (20 min)

## In Class Activity I (30 min)

1. Create a new GitHub repo and clone it locally.
2. Complete the [Introduction to Testing in Go](https://tutorialedge.net/golang/intro-testing-in-go/) mini-tutorial.
3. Commit and push your code to GitHub.

## BREAK (10 min)

## In Class Activity II (30 min)

1. Using the same repository as earlier, complete the [Introduction to Benchmarking Your Go Programs](https://tutorialedge.net/golang/benchmarking-your-go-programs/) mini-tutorial.
2. Commit and push your code to GitHub.
3. Slack the link to the class channel to indicate that you've completed both tutorials.

## Wrap Up (5 min)

Consider how you can practically apply the techniques discussed in class today to improve the code quality and performance of your MakeUtility project!
